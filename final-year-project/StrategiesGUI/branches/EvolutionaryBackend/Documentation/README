The project is made up of three packages:
src contains all strategy classes and those necessary to run tournaments.
testsrc contains all JUnit test classes.
guisrc contains both java and fxml files used to create and control the GUI.

To run the program using these files (instead of an executable):
Ensure Javafx and the relevant eclipse plugin is installed
Open guisrc/Main
Select Run as -> Java application from the run menu

An executable is provided in the executable folder of the project so it can be run from any machine.
