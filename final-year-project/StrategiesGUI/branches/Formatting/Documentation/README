In my program directory, in the folder labelled Executable, I have created an executable jar file of my program. 
Running the program requires installation of the Java Runtime Environment which can be found at https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html but is likely to already be installed on the user's computer. 
The jar file can then be run by navigating to its folder in the command line and entering the command - java -jar ZFAC043.jar

It is possible to compile and run the program from the code however there is no difference between the code version and the executable provided. 
In order to run the program from the code using eclipse the JavaFX package must be installed - https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/ contains versions for Windows, MacOS and Linux. 
The JavaFX plugin must also be installed through the eclipse marketplace. It is then possible to run the program by opening guisrc/Main and selecting Run as -> Java application from the run menu.

I have created a user guide to explain the functionality of my program in case the user does not have pre-existing knowledge of the prisoner's dilemma or anything is unclear. 
This can be accessed through the help menu at the top of the program and I have also included it in the Documentation folder.
