The project is made up of three packages:
src contains all strategy classes and those necessary to run tournaments.
testsrc contains all JUnit test classes.
guisrc contains both java and fxml files used to create and control the GUI.

In my program directory, in the folder labelled Executable, I have created an executable jar file of my program. 
Running the program requires installation of the Java Runtime Environment which can be found at https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html but is likely to already be installed on the user's computer. 
The JavaFX package must be installed - https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/ contains versions for Windows, MacOS and Linux. 
The version present in the build path of this program is JavaSE 1.8.
The jar file can then be run by navigating to the folder containing it in the command line and entering the command:
java --module-path PATH --add-modules javafx.fxml --add-modules javafx.controls -jar ZFAC043.final.jar
where PATH is replaced with the path to the JavaFX SDK which should end in \lib

I have created a user guide to explain the functionality of my program in case the user does not have pre-existing knowledge of the prisoner's dilemma or anything is unclear. 
This can be accessed through the help menu at the top of the program and I have also included it in the Documentation folder.
